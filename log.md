The user wants me to open an Excel workbook at the specific path `/Users/vinoddu/Documents/code/MCPXcel/Data_definition_v1.xlsx` and return the workbook_id along with effective limits.

Looking at the environment details, I can see that `Data_definition_v1.xlsx` is listed in the current working directory files, so the file exists.

I need to use the MCP Excel server tool `open_workbook` to accomplish this task. Let me check the required parameters:

- path: (required) Absolute or allowed path to an Excel workbook (.xlsx, .xlsm, .xltx, .xltm)

The user has provided the full absolute path: `/Users/vinoddu/Documents/code/MCPXcel/Data_definition_v1.xlsx`

I have all the required information to proceed with the tool use.

I'll open the Excel workbook at the specified path and return the workbook ID along with the effective limits.

Successfully retrieved the workbook structure for workbook ID `50f31033-a5dc-4d36-a66a-d4126e5c927e`.

__Workbook Structure:__

__Total Sheets:__ 2

__Sheet 1: "Overview"__

- Dimensions: 595 rows × 18 columns
- Headers: Region, BU, Data type, Source, Source Field Name, Technical Field Name, Table, Source confirmed, and 10 additional columns

- Dimensions: 33 rows × 11 columns
- Headers: GCF, GDS, KPI, Can be calculated?, and 7 additional columns

The workbook contains data definition information with an overview sheet containing the main data catalog (595 entries) and a calculations sheet with computational logic (33 entries).

Using search_data, search sheet Definitions for regex [0-9] with regex=true, max_results=2, snapshot_cols=5. Return meta.total, meta.returned, meta.truncated, and show the JSON text results. Save meta.nextCursor if present.

The user wants me to use the search_data tool to search for a regex pattern [0-9] (which matches any digit) in a sheet called "Definitions". However, from the previous structure listing, I saw that the workbook has two sheets: "Overview" and "calculations". There's no sheet called "Definitions".

I should proceed with the search as requested, but I suspect it will fail because the sheet name doesn't exist. Let me try the search with the exact parameters they specified:

- workbook_id: 50f31033-a5dc-4d36-a66a-d4126e5c927e
- sheet: "Definitions"
- query: "[0-9]"
- regex: true
- max_results: 2
- snapshot_cols: 5

The user wants me to return meta.total, meta.returned, meta.truncated, and show the JSON text results, plus save meta.nextCursor if present.

I'll search the "Definitions" sheet for the regex pattern [0-9] as requested, though I note that the workbook structure showed sheets named "Overview" and "calculations" rather than "Definitions".

The user wants me to continue the previous search using pagination with the cursor. However, looking at the previous search result, there was no meta.nextCursor provided in the response. The response only contained the JSON array of results without any metadata fields like meta.total, meta.returned, meta.truncated, or meta.nextCursor.

Since there was no meta.nextCursor in the previous response, I cannot continue the search with pagination. I should inform the user that there was no cursor provided in the previous response.

I cannot continue the search with a cursor because the previous search result did not include a `meta.nextCursor` value. The previous response only contained the JSON results array without any metadata fields.

Looking back at the previous search result, there was no pagination metadata provided - no `meta.total`, `meta.returned`, `meta.truncated`, or `meta.nextCursor` fields were included in the response. This suggests either:

1. The search returned all available results (no more pages)
2. The response format doesn't include metadata for this particular search
3. The search was limited by the `max_results=2` parameter and there may be more results, but no cursor was provided

__Missing Metadata:__

- No `meta.nextCursor` was provided
- No `meta.total`, `meta.returned`, or `meta.truncated` fields were included

- Execute a successful initial search to get a meta.nextCursor
- Resume searches using cursor pagination
- Verify meta.truncated behavior
- Confirm that the final page omits nextCursor

__Available Sheets for Pagination Testing:__ To successfully test pagination behavior, the search would need to target one of the existing sheets:

- "Overview" (595 rows × 18 columns)
- "calculations" (33 rows × 11 columns)

__Expected Pagination Behavior:__ If testing were possible on an existing sheet:

1. Initial search would return results with meta.nextCursor (if more results exist)
2. Subsequent cursor-based searches would continue pagination
3. When meta.truncated=false, the response should omit meta.nextCursor
4. This indicates all matching results have been retrieved

__Cursor Corruption Test Results:__

Cannot perform cursor corruption testing because:

1. __No Valid Cursor Available:__ All previous search attempts on the "Definitions" sheet failed with `INVALID_SHEET: sheet not found`

2. __No Successful Pagination:__ Since no searches have succeeded, there has been no `meta.nextCursor` returned from any previous operations

3. __Cannot Modify Non-Existent Cursor:__ There is no "last nextCursor" to modify and test corruption behavior

__Missing Prerequisites:__ To test cursor corruption/validation, I would need:

- A successful initial search that returns a valid `meta.nextCursor`
- The ability to modify one character in that cursor
- Then attempt to resume with the corrupted cursor

__Expected Behavior:__ If a valid cursor were available and corrupted, the expected result would be:

```javascript
Error: CURSOR_INVALID: failed to decode cursor; reopen workbook and restart pagination
```

__Testing Limitation:__ The system's sheet validation (correctly rejecting "Definitions") prevents reaching the pagination stage where cursors would be generated and could be tested for corruption handling.

Run a search to get a valid nextCursor. Then write any value to a cell on Definitions (e.g., use apply_formula or write_range). Now try to resume with the pre-write cursor. Expect CURSOR_INVALID (workbook changed).

Still no nextCursor provided. Let me try a broader search that might generate more results and pagination:

Cline wants to use a tool on the `excel` MCP server:

search_data

Auto-approve

Search for values or regex patterns with optional column filters and bounded row snapshots

Arguments

```json
{
  "workbook_id": "50f31033-a5dc-4d36-a66a-d4126e5c927e",
  "sheet": "Overview",
  "query": "EU",
  "regex": false,
  "max_results": 2
}
```

__Cursor Invalidation Test Results:__

__Issue Encountered:__ Cannot perform the cursor invalidation test as requested because:

1. __No nextCursor Generated:__ Multiple search attempts on the "Overview" sheet returned results but no `meta.nextCursor` was provided in any response:

   - Search for "GCF" (max_results=1): 1 result, no cursor
   - Search for "GCF" (max_results=5): 5 results, no cursor
   - Search for "EU" (max_results=2): 2 results, no cursor

2. __Missing Pagination Metadata:__ The search responses contain only the JSON results array without any metadata fields (`meta.total`, `meta.returned`, `meta.truncated`, `meta.nextCursor`)

3. __Cannot Test Workbook Change Detection:__ Without a valid cursor from a successful paginated search, I cannot:

   - Apply a formula to the "Definitions" sheet (which doesn't exist anyway)
   - Test cursor invalidation after workbook modification
   - Verify the expected `CURSOR_INVALID` error for workbook changes

__Possible Reasons for Missing Cursors:__

- The search results may be complete (no more pages needed)
- The pagination system may only provide cursors when results exceed certain thresholds
- The response format may not include metadata for these particular searches

__Expected Test Behavior:__ If cursors were available, the test would:

1. Get a valid nextCursor from initial search
2. Modify the workbook (apply formula to any sheet)
3. Attempt to resume with the pre-modification cursor
4. Expect: `CURSOR_INVALID: workbook changed` error

I'll close the workbook using the workbook_id that was opened earlier:

close_workbook

Close a previously opened workbook handle

__Workbook Closed Successfully__

The Excel workbook has been closed successfully.

__Final Status:__

- Workbook ID: `50f31033-a5dc-4d36-a66a-d4126e5c927e`
- Status: `closed`
- File: `/Users/vinoddu/Documents/code/MCPXcel/Data_definition_v1.xlsx`

The workbook handle has been released and is no longer available for operations. Any subsequent attempts to use this workbook_id will result in errors until the workbook is reopened with a new handle.
